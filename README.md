# CS250-Software-Development-Lifecycle


_How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?_

**You interpret user needs into user stories with the developing team by outlining a plan that turns into a wokring code design. User stories help by creating the perspective based on what the user requirements are.**



_How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?_

**The approach should be in full transparency by continually working with the devloping team on integrating the current program in iterations. The agile processes that I would hope to plan in the future are Scrum, Lean Software Development, Disciplined Agile and the Crystal Method. Again, this all depends on the size, structure and availability.**


_What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?_

**A good team member in a software devlopment environment is someone who practices good standards, is transparent, listens, is respectful, collaborates on team meetings and maintains team goals. Someone who can learn, contribute, has passion and can deliver is someone who enjoys being a part of a team process..**
